DESCRIPTION:
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.
    For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".
Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.
 

TEST CASES:
Input: s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
Output: "This is a sentence"
Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "This1 is2 a3 sentence4", then remove the numbers.

Input: s = "Myself2 Me1 I4 and3"
Output: "Me Myself and I"
Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "Me1 Myself2 and3 I4", then remove the numbers.

Constraints:
    2 <= s.length <= 200
    s consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, spaces, and digits from 1 to 9.
    The number of words in s is between 1 and 9.
    The words in s are separated by a single space.
    s contains no leading or trailing spaces.
